# Experimental PS3 save importer for TU2

`scripts/import_ps3_save.py` inspects an extracted RPCS3 Diablo III: Reaper of
Souls save and can produce a separate state directory for the Xbox TU2 build.
It uses only Python's standard library. Imported gameplay and save/reload
compatibility have not been validated.

## Inspect without writing

```sh
python3 scripts/import_ps3_save.py /path/to/BLUS31437-AUTOSAVE
```

Optionally compare versions and hero filenames against an existing Xbox TU2
save, also read-only:

```sh
python3 scripts/import_ps3_save.py /path/to/BLUS31437-AUTOSAVE \
  --reference-save /path/to/xbox-state/B13EBABEBABEBABE/394F07D4/00000001/d3save
```

Inspection reports account and hero versions, embedded hero IDs, the proposed
filenames, and payload hashes. The format check currently accepts account
version 108 and hero/digest version 905, observed in the local PS3 and Xbox TU2
references. Matching versions do not establish compatibility of every nested
field or platform-specific value.

## Import into a new directory

```sh
python3 scripts/import_ps3_save.py /path/to/BLUS31437-AUTOSAVE \
  --output-state /path/to/new-ps3-import-state
```

The output directory must not exist. The importer refuses to merge or overwrite
an existing state directory, or write within/above the PS3 source or optional
Xbox reference directory. It checks index/hero ID consistency, filenames,
duplicate identifiers, bounded file sizes and protobuf structure. Input payload
files must be regular files rather than symlinks.

Output:

```text
new-ps3-import-state/
  import-report.json
  B13EBABEBABEBABE/394F07D4/00000001/d3save/
    account.dat
    profile.dat
    heroes/<16-digit-hero-id>.dat
```

The default XUID is the SDK's default emulated profile. `--xuid` selects another
16-digit hexadecimal profile ID; it controls the storage directory only and
does not rewrite account or hero identities inside the payloads.

Account, profile and hero file bytes are preserved exactly, including unknown
protobuf fields and the original rolling XOR encoding. PS3 hero filenames use
the low 32 bits of the embedded ID; the Xbox reference uses all 64 bits. The
importer checks this relationship rather than inventing new hero IDs.

`HEROES.IDX` is used for validation but not copied. PS3 preferences and platform
metadata (`PREFS.DAT`, `PARAM.SFO`, `PARAM.PFD`, `ICON0.PNG`) are omitted. The
inspected RPCS3 reference has no `PARAM.PFD`; this tool does not decrypt the
additional protection on physical-console exports. Preferences regeneration
and any platform-specific payload adjustments still need runtime testing.

No Xbox content header is fabricated. The inspected SDK's content manager can
enumerate directories without a header by constructing metadata from the path;
complete game loading still needs validation.

## Try the imported save with TU2

```sh
python3 scripts/run_linux.py --title-update tu2 --extra-features \
  --game-dir /path/to/updated-tu2-disc \
  --state-dir /path/to/new-ps3-import-state --vulkan_device=1
```

You can also import and launch in one command:

```sh
python3 scripts/run_linux.py --title-update tu2 --extra-features \
  --game-dir /path/to/updated-tu2-disc \
  --import-ps3-save /path/to/BLUS31437-AUTOSAVE --vulkan_device=1
```

Without `--state-dir`, this selects a separate `souls-of-the-reaper-tu2-ps3-import`
application-data directory. On first launch it imports the source; later launches
reuse the imported save without replacing subsequent gameplay progress. An
existing directory without a matching import report is rejected. To start another
import, select a new `--state-dir`.

This uses the imported state rather than your usual TU2 state. Future game saves
write to that imported state. The importer never mounts the RPCS3 source as a
writable save location.

Validate character selection, inventory/equipment, stash, currency, quests,
progression and hardcore status, then save, exit and reload. The report retains
`runtime_validated: false`; it records import provenance rather than tracking
later gameplay checks. This is a one-way experimental import, not PS3 export or
bidirectional synchronization.

The save encoding and field interpretation were investigated using
[GoobyCorp/D3Edit](https://github.com/GoobyCorp/D3Edit/blob/master/D3Edit.py)
and its published protobuf descriptors, then compared against the local saves.
No editor runtime or generated protobuf modules are required by the importer.

Regression checks are part of:

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'
```
